              4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

              We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to access or

              purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal

              cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although
              we will do our best to protect your personal information,
              transmission of personal information to and from our Services is
              at your own risk. You should only access the services within a

              <br /><br />
              7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
              <br />
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you
              can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
              about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No
              uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
              signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
              to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
              communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
              for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
              we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
              this privacy policy.
              <br /><br />
              8. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?
              <br />
              We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated
              version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the
              updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If
              we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you
              either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
              directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review
              this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are
              protecting your information.
